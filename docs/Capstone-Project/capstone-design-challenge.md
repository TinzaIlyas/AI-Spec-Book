# Capstone Project: Design Challenge

## Overview

Ye capstone project aapko physical AI aur humanoid robotics ke concepts ko practical design challenge mein apply karne ka mauka dega. Aap ek complete humanoid robot system design karenge jo multiple modules ke concepts ko integrate karega.

## Project Objectives

- Apply concepts learned across all modules
- Integrate sensing, planning, control aur actuation
- Address real-world constraints aur challenges
- Develop systematic engineering approach

## Design Challenge

Design a humanoid robot capable of performing basic household tasks like object manipulation, navigation, aur simple interaction. Robot should be able to:

- Navigate through cluttered environments
- Recognize aur pick up objects
- Maintain balance during tasks
- Interact safely with humans

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Autonomous navigation in indoor environments
- Object detection aur grasping
- Human interaction capabilities
- Task planning aur execution

### Non-functional Requirements
- Real-time performance (response time < 100ms)
- Safety compliance
- Energy efficiency
- Robustness to environmental variations

## Design Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- User needs assessment
- Environmental constraints
- Safety considerations
- Performance targets

### 2. Conceptual Design
- System architecture
- Component selection
- Interface definitions
- Technology choices

### 3. Detailed Design
- Control algorithms
- Sensor fusion strategies
- Mechanical design
- Software architecture

### 4. Implementation Planning
- Development phases
- Testing strategies
- Validation methods
- Risk mitigation

## Evaluation Criteria

Aapke design ko in criteria ke basis par evaluate kiya jayega:

- Technical feasibility
- Innovation aur creativity
- Safety considerations
- Cost effectiveness
- Performance metrics
- Scalability

## Deliverables

- System architecture document
- Detailed design specifications
- Simulation results (if applicable)
- Implementation timeline
- Testing plan

Ye project aapke learning ko consolidate karne aur practical skills develop karne ke liye zaroori hai.
